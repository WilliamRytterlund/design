God dagens, jag heter James och kommer från Storbritanien och därför är det enklare för mig att hitta information och tips på engelska som det är mitt huvudspråk.
Let's go!

Några tips för nya managers - På engelska
-----------------------------------

**Get Ready Before You Get Promoted:**
This may sound counter-intuitive (and many cases it may be too late), but if you're on the cusp of moving up then are things you can do to get ready for your new role including reading up on the topic, taking courses, and learning from others. If you're offered a promotion and you’re not prepared, you may want to kick yourself for not boning up beforehand.



**Recognize That It's a New Job:**
Even though you were most likely promoted in a department where let's say you were the best engineer, you are no longer an engineer; you’re a manager overseeing engineers. While you may not have mastered your new job, you do have a track record of success in that area, so focus on your ability to master a job.

**Learn to Let Go of the Details:**
Focus on the big picture and what your employees are accomplishing on a daily basis and whether or not they are meeting their goals. Remember, you’re not being paid to do your old job so leave the minutia up to your staff.

**You’re a Boss, Not a Friend:**
One of the most frequent mistakes new managers make is that they try to be friends with their employees. This is especially hard when you get promoted over your peers, and you're now managing friends who were once peers. You’re now in a position of power and authority and being friends with one employee and not another creates perceptions of bias and favoritism. You can be friends outside of the office, but while in the office, keep the interaction professional.

**Learn to Deal With Performance Issues:**
Your previous boss may have been sweeping poor performance issues under the rug. Part of your new job will be learning a consistent and effective way to deal with employees who are not performing up to standard.

**Pay Attention to Your New Team:**
While you may be the team leader of your team, you’re now a member of a brand new team; your manager’s management team. Managing sideways is just as important as managing up and down.
